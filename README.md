# Ubishooter

Simple prototype based on https://github.com/straker/galaxian-canvas-game. You can either play the game
with Kinect gesture controls or a mobile phone.

To play with gesture controls just scan the QR code and the game will start.

For Kinect controls, click on the Kinect icon and start playing.

# Running the game

Make sure you change the QR code address to something your mobile phone can access to in ```game.js.coffee```.
